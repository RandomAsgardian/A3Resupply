# A3Resupply
A lightweight script to resupply your squad!

This script is a custom module for ZEN. With it, you can spawn (or paradrop) an ammo crate with ammo for your whole unit! This lightweight script will add 15 mags of each player on a server's primary weapon, and toss it in the box. It will then either spawn the crate on the module position, or spawn it in the air and attach a parachute and red smoke to help find it.
The mod ZEN (https://zen-mod.github.io/ZEN/#/) is required for this script to function. The spawners for the resupply are under "Custom Modules) in the Zeus Interface
